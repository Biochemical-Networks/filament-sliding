Classes:
*Microtubule - Lattice of binding sites. It has a certain lattice spacing and a length.
*MobileMicrotubule : Microtubule - derived type, also has a position, diffusion constant. Can move.

*Crosslinker - abstract class, spring with two binding sites. Has a spring constant, and virtual move, bind, and unbind functions. 
*PassiveLinker : Crosslinker - 
*ActiveLinker : Crosslinker -
*HybridLinker : Crosslinker -

Microtubules and crosslinkers are objects with some properties and methods that can be used to update their state, but propagation is handled externally. 

Input file:
Write template class for input: parameter name (string), value (T), and unit (string). 
Write container class for all input parameters. std::vector? Add function to count the number of members, so that the number of parameters is known.
