TO DO FOR CROSSLINKER INDUCED MT FRICTION

* Add an external force to the program, and add methods to sample the position of the mobile microtubule.
Now, I made the program depend on GSL, but we can derive simple equations for the differences between psi (digamma) functions, involving a sum over fractions.

* Add algorithm (extra program or bash script?) for doing several runs with several parameter sets

* Perform runs with different maximum stretches, find the (logarithm of the rate) vs. (free energy barrier height) plots,
and investigate for which maximum stretch the slope is closest to -1; i.e., r = r0 exp(-s F/kT) has the best fit for s=1.

* Study reaction rate theory: does the prefactor depend on the number of linkers, or on the length of the microtubule?

* Visualise the system using OpenGL

* Add more output methods
