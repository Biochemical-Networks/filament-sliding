TO DO FOR CROSSLINKER INDUCED MT FRICTION

* Change the external force added to the microtubule to reflect the better calculation of the free energy.
Now, I made the program depend on GSL, but we can derive simple equations for the differences between psi (digamma) functions, involving a sum over fractions.

* Add algorithm (extra program or bash script?) for doing several runs with several parameter sets

* Perform runs with different maximum stretches, find the (logarithm of the rate) vs. (free energy barrier height) plots and look at the positional histograms.
Does the free energy with a max stretch of 1 lattice spacing approximate that with larger max stretches?

* Study reaction rate theory: does the prefactor depend on the number of linkers, or on the length of the microtubule?
